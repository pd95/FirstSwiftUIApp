# Rebuild of app presented at WWDC 2019 Session 204: "Introducing SwiftUI: Building Your First App"

During session 204 "Introducing SwiftUI: Building Your First App", an App has been presented to illustrate the power of SwiftUI.
Sadly the code was not published. As the APIs in SwiftUI have evolved since the early seed in July 2019, parts of the application have to be written differently today.
